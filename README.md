# BARD-VCF
  A redesign of a discrete transistor VCF..The original project can be found at

  The core design is basically the same as the original project...I have changed a few resistor values for increased tuning range
  and greater feedback..The grounded end of the cuttoff pot has been placed slghtly below ground to low freq response..A highpass
  input has been added anlog with a buffer/gain op amp output...Doides D1 and D2 were added to keep the output from risising too 
  high, but there is not enough drive for them to provide any kind of clipping..
